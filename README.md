# reverse

This is a simple CLI tool for checking that arbitrarily-defined locations in code are kept
up-to-date. It uses user-defined regex matching to determine names and versions and produces errors
if any "usage locations" don't match the version in the original definition.

I originally made this tool for work on my [text editor](https://github.com/sharnoff/viri), but
you're welcome to use it as well. I'm open to suggestions for improvements :)
